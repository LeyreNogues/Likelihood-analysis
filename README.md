Maximum Likelihood analysis to study Lorentz Invariance Violation

This is a repository created from a private reposity in Bitbucket containing the public parts of it.
It shows the extrating of the required inputs from the data obtained with the MAGIC telescopes on Mrk421 flare, and their analysis using a Maximum Likelihood analysis to extract any possible time dispersion in the data due to Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). The LIV is a expected physical effect if the gravitational field presents a quantum behaviour. If indeed the gravitation is quantum we would we able to merge all the four fundamental forces in physics (gravitation, electromagnetism, weak and strong force) inside a single theory: The Theory of Everything (ToE). This is one of the main goals in modern physics.
